## 💡 Philosophy

This project is built on these principles:

### 1. Learning by Doing
Students don't just read about code - they write it, run it, break it, fix it, and deploy it!

### 2. Explain Everything
No "magic code" - every line is explained in detail. Understanding > memorization.

### 3. Make It Fun
Games are engaging! Learning should be enjoyable, not a chore.

### 4. Real-World Ready
Build skills used by professional developers, not just toy examples.

### 5. Everyone Can Code
With the right resources and support, anyone can learn programming.

### 6. Free & Open
Knowledge should be accessible to everyone, regardless of financial situation.
